The decision of the arbitrator shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties. Any arbitration award granted hereunder shall be enforceable under the applicable terms and conditions of the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1958 (the New York Convention), as amended to date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, NeuLynx shall have the right to seek injunctive relief or other equitable or legal remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of California, to which jurisdiction, for such purpose, you hereby irrevocably consent. The parties hereto expressly agree these Terms shall not be governed by the provisions of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. If you bring a legal action or claim against us in contravention of this Section 14, you agree you will reimburse us for our costs and expenses incurred in connection with contesting such action or claim; provided that we notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you failed to promptly withdraw the claim. In the event a non-English version of these Terms is created and there is a conflict of terms between such non-English version and the English version of these Terms, the English version will govern.
